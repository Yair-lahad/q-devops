This Repo is designed for a Job Interview preparation and "Rust Removal" after long period of no coding.
first i did some basic docker examples via docker-Desktop guides, then some basic k8s example localy to run a simple hello world using deploy.cmd ci-cd.
for the last step i try to make a git-to-k8s programs that mimics real life example that may be asked in the home assignment.
